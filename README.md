# Shopify Backend Challenge

This personal project is my submission for the Shopify Backend Challenge Winter 2021. It consists of two microservices that I built in Go including the Terraform HCL code to provision GCP resources and the Kubernetes
YAML configuration files. The project is separated into three repositories :
 * The present [shopify-backend-challenge](https://github.com/wtrep/shopify-backend-challenge) repository that contains the files related to the deployment of the microservices. 
 * The [shopify-backend-challenge-auth](https://github.com/wtrep/shopify-backend-challenge-auth) repository that contains the source code for the authentification microservice
 * The [shopify-backend-challenge-image](https://github.com/wtrep/shopify-backend-challenge-image) repository that contains the source code for the image microservice

Each repository contain details about its content.
